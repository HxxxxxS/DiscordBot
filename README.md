# Discord Spotify Bot
Updates the game you are playing to the current song playing on your Spotify app.  
Just a simple bot I made for fun using https://discord.js.org/#/ and https://github.com/nadavbar/node-spotify-webhelper
## How to install
To install and run this bot you will need the latest nodejs installed https://nodejs.org/en/  
You will have to download the DiscordSpotifyBot file https://github.com/wsmigielski/DiscordSpotifyBot/archive/master.zip  
Unzip the file  
Next you will need to find you client token  
To do this press `Ctrl + Shift + I` while on your discord app  
Then proceed to find the token and copy it
